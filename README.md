# Project: Private Events

## What's this

A project completed as part of [The Odin Ruby on Rails Learning Track](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/flight-booker) to dive into ActiveRecordâ€™s associations and working with Advanced Forms. The project involves building a website with similar functionality to the well known booking platform [Buddha Airways](https://www.buddhaair.com/).
